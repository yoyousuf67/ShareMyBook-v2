ShareMyBook is a book selling web application that deals with second hand books.
The application uses C2C model and minimizes the role of middleman.

## Technologies Used
 
The application is built using node.js for backend and semantic ui for front-end.
There are two parts of the application:
*RESTful API's => These API's are used to directly interact with the database using GET, POST, PUSH and DELETE methods.The RESTful API gives an oppurtunity to create a mobile application in the future without requiring a complete overhaul.
*Web application => The web application has its own backend which sends request to the RESTful API and then renders the recieved data.
